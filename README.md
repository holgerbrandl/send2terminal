Send To Terminal
================


<!-- Plugin description -->
Intellij plugin to send line or selection to a terminal
<!-- Plugin description end -->

The following modes are supported

* Send current line or selection (default shortcut `meta alt ENTER`)
* Send current and move focus to next line with expression (default shortcut `meta alt shift ENTER`)

Supported evaluation targets are

* [Cmdr](http://cmder.net/) via [conemu](https://conemu.github.io/) (Windows)
* [R GUI](https://www.r-project.org/) (Windows)
*   Terminal (MacOS)
*   [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (MacOS)



##  Kotlin Support

The plugin comes with special support for Kotlin, namely

1. Paste Mode Support:

With the stock Kotlin-REPL, one can not evaluate certain multi-line expressions such as
```kotlin
listOf("foo", "bar")
    .map{it+"2"}
```

Please vote for [KT-13319](https://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issue/KT-13319) to push for a REPL paste-mode. Alternatively you could use `kshell` from https://github.com/khud/sparklin and enable the paste mode support in the preferences of this plugin.

2. Automatic Import Detection

The plugin will detect imports in a kotlin document and will evaluate imports in the target terminal prior to the user selection/expression.


3. Expression Guessing

The plugin will guess the scope of the expression under the cursor when using the shortcut `ctr+alt+shift+enter`. The scope barriers are named fuctions or the file itself.


## Custom shortcut actions

Up to 4 custom actions can be defined to send the current selection/line to the evaluation target. Below some examples are shown for `R`

Those shortcut actions are exposed via the context menu and can be assigned to custom keyboard bindings:
